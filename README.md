# üî• HTB CampFire-1 ‚Äî Forensic Investigation of Kerberoasting 

## üß® The Problem  
A user reported suspicious files on their workstation, prompting the SOC team to initiate an investigation. The suspected threat was a **Kerberoasting attack** ‚Äî a credential harvesting technique targeting Active Directory environments. The objective was to confirm whether such an attack occurred, determine when and how it happened, and identify the attacker‚Äôs tooling and behavior.

## üõ† Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **PECmd (Eric Zimmerman)** | Parsing Windows Prefetch files |
| **Timeline Explorer** | Visualizing timeline activity from parsed artifacts |
| **Event Viewer** | Reviewing Security and PowerShell logs |
| **PowerShell Operational Logs** | Investigating ScriptBlock activity (Event ID 4104) |
| **Splunk (Simulated)** | Demonstrating SIEM detection with SPL queries |

## üîç Method (Investigation Steps)

1. **Artifact Preparation**  
   - Unzipped the provided `.zip` containing:  
     - Domain Controller security logs  
     - PowerShell-Operational logs  
     - Windows Prefetch files  
   - Used `PECmd` to convert prefetch files into a CSV and analyzed them with `Timeline Explorer`.

2. **Domain Log Analysis for Kerberoasting Indicators**  
   - Filtered **Event ID 4769** in the Domain Controller‚Äôs security logs.  
   - Narrowed results using Kerberoasting-specific traits:  
     - RC4-encrypted tickets (`0x17`)  
     - Non-system service accounts  
     - Successful ticket requests  
   - Identified the suspicious request event matching the attack pattern.

3. **Correlating PowerShell Activity on Workstation**  
   - Analyzed **Event ID 4104** from the PowerShell-Operational logs.  
   - Observed a script execution policy bypass and enumeration commands.  
   - Verified that these events aligned with the timeline of the suspicious Kerberos activity.

4. **Tracing Attacker Tool Execution with Prefetch**  
   - Loaded parsed Prefetch CSV into `Timeline Explorer`.  
   - Filtered for first-time executable launches around the attack window.  
   - Identified a known credential extraction tool frequently used for Kerberoasting.  
   - Reviewed the file loading behavior to confirm its full path and timing.

## ‚úÖ The Solution  
By correlating logs from the Domain Controller, workstation PowerShell activity, and Prefetch execution metadata, I confirmed a **Kerberoasting attack** occurred. The attacker enumerated Active Directory objects, bypassed script execution restrictions, and leveraged a post-exploitation tool to extract service tickets. This lab reinforces the importance of timeline correlation, endpoint visibility, and log analysis in detecting credential-based attacks.
